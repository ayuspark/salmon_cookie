        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>Have you ever been fishing, eating a cookie, and wondering "how can I combine my love for fishing with my love of cookies?!"<br /><br />
        We are a family of 4, and we have found our passion and realized our dreams. We are super happy. The answer to all this lies in Salmon Cookie.<br /><br />
        My name is Pat. I used to be a software engineer. But the job is so demanding, although I was able to earn tons of money, because I am just that good. Probably because I bought Amazon's stock from the 90s, and look at its price now. Oh man, I am rich.<br /><br />

        So the question in life is: how can I combine my love for fishing and cookies so that I can be the happiest man on earth. This is why I invented Salmon Cookies.<br /><br />
        I then asked my wife and kids to quit whatever they are doing to join me in the salmon cookie business. Since then, they couldn't be happier.<br /><br />
        What's is salmon cookie anyway? It's very simple: it's cookies made with salmon. Stupid. But the trick is: it never tastes like salmon. Maybe it's just marketing. But maybe you will have to try it so you'll know it.
